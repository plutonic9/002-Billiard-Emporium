<p>Feb 2 - Feb 3, 2015</p>
<br>
<p>Second project after completing Code School "Front End Foundations" course.  Wanted to experiment a bit more with content and background images.  Originally started with idea of 1920 (hd) browser width, but later realized that stuff had to be crammed up against left border, so it basically works with any width browser window.</p>
<br>
<p>Good Stuff:
<ol>Managed to figure out how to place background images ok.</ol>
<ol>I think the organization of html and css is fairly good, even if very redundant and inefficient.</ol>
<ol>Nice menu on main page... graphics and text.</ol>
<ol>Learned some more Photoshop while working on it.</ol>
<ol>Becoming more comfortable with writing -html- and -css--. That was really the point.</ol>
<ol>Nice pointing guy</ol>
<br>
<p>Bad Stuff:</p>
<ol>Boring.  Static and no interaction.  Fatal</ol>
<ol>*Really* gotta learn to use CSS selectors better.  It is so easy to fall into the trap of just making everything its own -class- and just referencing that.  It is so obvious that much of it can be redone with just basic selectors and better use of -class-.  Maybe come back later and clean that up? (only getting away with it cause this is such a tiny project)</ol>
<ol>Everything is jammed up against the left border of the browser.  That is because I cannot figure out how to center text in the middle of the pool table background, if the pool table graphic is floating in the horizontal middle of the window.  Somehow need a way to specify the left border of the graphic should be the starting point for all text and such.  ie. I need an anchor point, and right now I only know how to use the left border of the browser.</ol>
<ol>Couldn't figure out how to overlay text on the -img- graphics on the three product pages.... ie. it would be nice to have the product info text overlaying the photos, but cannot see how to do that with the -img- graphics.  Maybe use background -url- graphics instead?  Particularly a visual problem with the cue sticks page.</ol>
<br>
<ol>Clunky navigation - "Go Back to HOME PAGE" - really?</ol>
<br>
<ol>Still haven't dealt with -form- or -input- stuff...</ol>
<br>
<ol>See if I can figure out GIT for this and future stuff</ol>
